# Cursor Project Rules

1. **Do Not Ask for Permission**
   - Proceed with implementation steps without requesting user approval for each action.

2. **Checklist Updates**
   - After completing each implementation step, update the `Implementation_Checklist.md` to reflect progress.

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for each module or function where appropriate to ensure correctness and reliability.

4. **Modularity**
   - Structure code in a modular fashion, separating concerns and making components reusable and maintainable.

These rules are intended to streamline development, ensure quality, and maintain a clear record of progress.
