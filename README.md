# Financial Price Movement Prediction System

This project implements a machine learning system to predict the price movement direction of a financial instrument (e.g., stock, ETF, crypto) using deep learning models such as LSTM.

## Project Overview
- Predicts whether the next period's closing price will be higher or lower than the current period
- Modular pipeline: data collection, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment
- Easily adaptable to different financial instruments and data providers

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
